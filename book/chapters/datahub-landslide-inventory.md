# Landslide Data Inventory

:::{note}
**The authoritative data inventory for the landslide digital twin.** This page catalogs
every dataset that flows through the shallow / deep-seated [landslide](hazard-landslides)
digital twin — from **raw external products**, through **deterministically derived layers**,
to **model outputs** — with sources, access/sensitivity, spatial/temporal resolution, and
limitations. For derived and modelled products it also records the **model used**, its **raw
inputs**, and its **assumptions**.

It is the landslide-specific companion to the [DataHub](datahub) and follows the four-part
provenance standard (source · measurement · resolution · uncertainty) defined in the
[DataHub Integration Guide §2](datahub-integration-guide). Variable names follow the Landlab
`field__name` vocabulary so layers drop straight into the
[`landlab-debrisflow`](https://github.com/gaia-hazlab/landlab-debrisflow) backend.
:::

## How to read this inventory

Data are grouped by **provenance tier**, because that determines how they should be trusted,
stored, and calibrated:

1. **Raw / observed inputs** — imported from an external archive. Treated as observations or
   prepared inputs, *not* model outputs. Calibration should hold these fixed.
2. **Derived variables** — computed deterministically from raw inputs and documented rules.
   Not observed, but fully reproducible given the input stack and config.
3. **Modelled variables & outputs** — produced by the ecohydrology and slope-stability
   components during a run. These carry model assumptions and uncertainty.

Every column matters: **Access / sensitivity** flags keys, licenses, or withheld locations;
**Native resolution** and **Cadence** record the support a value actually has (so a
downscaled 9 km pixel is never mistaken for a 10 m one — the
[footprint-leakage](pillar-1-soil-reanalysis) problem); **Limitations** captures the caveat a
downstream modeler needs before using the layer.

The **primary target** the whole pipeline exists to produce is
`landslide__probability_of_failure` ($P_f$, dimensionless 0–1). The `fire-debrisflow-ml`
targets `dem_diff` / `debris_flow` are a *different* ML target and must not be confused with
the DT hazard target.

## 1. Raw / observed inputs (external products)

These are fetched from external archives and prepared onto the working grid. They are the
fixed foundation of the model and of calibration.

## 2. Derived variables (deterministic transformations)

Computed from the raw stack and documented rules — reproducible, not observed. They should be
**traceable**, with their generating rule recorded.

| Derived variable | Computed from | Units / dims | Equation or rule | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `drainage_area` | DEM + boundary conditions + Landlab `FlowAccumulator` | m², `[n_nodes]` | Landlab flow routing | Upslope area & routing diagnostic |
| `topographic__slope` | DEM | gradient, `[n_nodes]` | `topographic__steepest_slope` copied to required field name | Required by `LandslideProbability`; **unit convention (gradient vs degrees) must be explicit** |
| `topographic__specific_contributing_area` | `drainage_area`, `grid.dx` | m, `[n_nodes]` | $a = A_d / \Delta x$ | Hydrologic term in relative wetness |
| Aspect, hillshade | DEM | `[n_nodes]` | GIS terrain derivations | Diagnostics / interpretation only |
| `soil__transmissivity` | $K_{sat}$, soil thickness | m² day⁻¹, `[n_nodes]` | $T = K_{sat}\cdot 2.5 \cdot h_s$, floor 0.01 | Static transmissivity proxy; **2.5 anisotropy factor is a calibration lever** |
| `vegetation__live_leaf_area_index` | PFT lookup | `[n_nodes]` | grass 1.5, shrub 2.0, tree 4.0, bare 1.0 | Controls PET & vegetation response |
| `vegetation__cover_fraction` | LAI | `[n_nodes]` | $\text{cover} = \text{LAI}/4$ | Ecohydrology vegetation cover input |
| `soil_moisture__initial_saturation_fraction` | SMAP $\theta_0$ (or midpoint heuristic), porosity | `[n_cells]` | $S_0 = \theta_0 / n$ | Initial water state — **shifts the whole event response** |
| `field_capacity_saturation` | `field__capacity`, porosity | `[n_cells]` | $S_{fc} = \mathrm{clip}(\theta_{fc}/n, 0.05, 0.98)$ | Drainage-onset threshold |
| `wilting_point_saturation` | `wilting__point`, porosity | `[n_cells]` | $S_{wp} = \mathrm{clip}(\theta_{wp}/n, 0.01, 0.95);\ S_{wp}\le S_{fc}-0.01$ | Water-stress threshold |
| `snow_fraction_arrays` | precip, Tmin, Tmax | `[time, n_nodes]` | linear rain–snow partition between $T_{snow}$ and $T_{rain}$ | Splits storm water rain vs snow |

| `water_input_arrays` | rain + melt | mm, `[time, n_nodes]` | $W_{in} = \text{rain} + \text{melt}$ | Liquid water into ecohydrology |
| `mean_recharge` / `max_recharge` | daily recharge arrays | mm day⁻¹, `[n_nodes]` | temporal mean / max | Scenario-ready recharge summaries |
| `routed_recharge_max` | `max_recharge` + routing | recharge-equiv., `[n_nodes]` | `surface_water__discharge` / `drainage_area` | Upslope-averaged recharge scenario |
| `groundwater__recharge_mean` / `std` | local or routed recharge | mm day⁻¹, `[n_nodes]` | `std = 0.1 × mean` (active setup) | Direct input to `LandslideProbability` recharge sampling |

:::{warning}
**Current notebook state (active run).** The final `LandslideProbability` call currently uses
**local `max_recharge`**, *not* `routed_recharge_max` (which is computed but not the active
forcing). The burn-severity cohesion block is present but **does not currently reduce
cohesion**. Both are flagged calibration / structural choices in §4 below.

## 3. Modelled variables & outputs

Produced by the ecohydrology and slope-stability components. These carry model assumptions and
should be published with provenance and uncertainty.

| Output | Producing component | Units / dims | Meaning | Primary use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `soil_moisture__saturation_fraction` | `SoilMoisture` | fraction, `[time, n_cells]` | Root-zone saturation | Hydrologic state; **SMAP comparison** (× porosity) |

| `routed_runoff_m3_day` | `FlowAccumulator` post-proc | m³ day⁻¹, `[n_nodes]` | Routed runoff discharge | Hydrologic diagnostic only |

## 4. Models behind the derived & modelled products

Each derived/modelled product above is generated by one of the following model components.
For each: what it does, its **raw inputs** (and their limitations), and its **assumptions**.

### Infinite-slope slope stability — Landlab `LandslideProbability`

Produces the primary target $P_f$ and the wetness/saturation diagnostics. Solves the
**infinite-slope factor of safety** probabilistically: a Monte Carlo draw over uncertain
parameters yields $P_f = \Pr(FS \le 1)$ (full equations in
[Pillar 2 §2.3](pillar-2-nowcasting-susceptibility)) [@strauch2018].

- **Inputs:** `topographic__slope`, `topographic__specific_contributing_area`,
  `soil__thickness`, `soil__density`, `soil__internal_friction_angle`,
  `soil__transmissivity`, `soil__{min,mode,max}_total_cohesion`, and
  `groundwater__recharge_mean/std`.
- **Limitations of inputs:** soil strength & cohesion come from pedotransfer/lookup on
  SOLUS/POLARIS (large uncertainty); transmissivity inherits the 2.5 anisotropy assumption;
  recharge forcing depends on the upstream ecohydrology and recharge-scenario choice.
- **Assumptions:** infinite-slope geometry (planar failure, slope-parallel flow); steady-state
  topographic wetness from recharge & transmissivity [@beven1979; @montgomery1994]; cohesion
  represented as a triangular min/mode/max distribution; parameters spatially independent
  across Monte Carlo draws; `number_of_iterations` (1000) controls only sampling noise, **not**
  a physical parameter.

The **shallow vs deep-seated** distinction is a swapped *hydrology closure* into this same
engine — shallow uses vadose-zone topographic wetness, deep-seated uses the water-table / head
field from the [Soil Reanalysis Product](pillar-1-soil-reanalysis) — not a different model.

### Ecohydrology water balance — Landlab `SoilMoisture` + PET

Generates root-zone saturation, leakage (the recharge source), runoff, ET, and water stress.

- **Inputs:** `water_input_arrays` (rain + melt), `field_capacity_saturation`,
  `wilting_point_saturation`, porosity, $K_{sat}$, LAI/cover by PFT, and PET drivers
  (latitude, albedo, vegetation height, wind, humidity, lapse rate).
- **Limitations of inputs:** PRISM forcing is 4 km; PET parameters are largely heuristic;
  field-capacity/wilting thresholds inherit soil-product uncertainty.
- **Assumptions:** single root-zone bucket per PFT; `ksat_factor = 0.5` scales infiltration /
  leakage / runoff partition; cover fraction = LAI/4; ET from a PET formulation with prescribed
  vegetation parameters.

### Snow partition & melt — degree-day

Splits precipitation into rain and snow and tracks SWE.

- **Inputs:** PRISM precip, Tmin, Tmax; initial SWE.
- **Assumptions:** linear rain–snow partition between $T_{snow}$ and $T_{rain}$; degree-day
  melt with `melt_factor` and base temperature $T_{base}$; SWE bookkeeping
  $SWE_t = SWE_{t-1} + \text{snow} - \text{melt}$. Calibrate against ERA5 SWE.

### Flow routing — Landlab `FlowAccumulator`

Computes `drainage_area`, `surface_water__discharge`, and the routed-recharge / routed-runoff
diagnostics.

- **Inputs:** DEM, boundary conditions, `water__unit_flux_in`.
- **Limitations:** routing is sensitive to the DEM and the **boundary-condition elevation
  cutoff (337 m)**; arbitrary tiling can break hydrologic routing — watersheds are the safer
  model unit.
- **Assumptions:** single-/multiple-flow-direction routing on the working grid; contributing
  area is well-defined only within the routed domain.

### Precipitation → recharge conversion

Turns observed/forecast precipitation (after the water balance) into the recharge forcing for
the slope-stability model, summarized as `mean`/`max`, optionally routed.

- **Assumptions:** the chosen recharge summary (mean vs max) and the **local vs routed**
  scenario are *structural* choices that change the spatial pattern of forcing; recharge
  uncertainty modeled as `std = 0.1 × mean`.

### Forecast weather leg — NVIDIA Earth2Studio

A *weather-provider* branch (GraphCast / AIFS / Pangu / StormCast), **not** the landslide model
itself. It extracts model precipitation, converts `tp`/`APCP` to consistent mm/day, downscales
to the working grid, converts to recharge, then runs the same Landlab backend (or a future
surrogate) to produce a forecast $P_f$.

- **Limitations:** precipitation is the least-skillful forecast field; accumulation conventions
  differ by model; coarse global grids need downscaling; weight licenses vary by model.
- **Assumptions:** forecast precip is the dominant dynamic driver; static layers and model
  parameters are held fixed across the forecast horizon. Forecast outputs must retain
  `init_time`, `lead_time`, `valid_time`, `model_name`, `forecast_version`.

:::{note}
**ML surrogate (future).** A surrogate is *not* a replacement for Landlab. Trained on
accumulated Landlab labels + historical/forecast forcing, its role is **acceleration** for
PNW-wide screening and large ensembles, with Landlab retained as the reference model to
generate labels and audit high-risk areas.
:::

## 5. Calibration targets

Calibration should constrain parameters against the **right observable**, not only against the
final landslide map. Targets, in recommended sequence:

| Observable target | Best constrains | How to compare | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SMAP** daily soil moisture | initial saturation, `ksat_factor`, root-zone depths, field/wilting thresholds | AOI / core-node mean volumetric SM time series | High |
| SMAP sub-daily (Pacific-time) | timing & aggregation mismatch | overlay sub-daily SMAP vs daily model states | Medium |
| **ERA5 SWE** | $T_{snow}$/$T_{rain}$, `melt_factor`, $T_{base}$, initial SWE | daily SWE mean & depletion timing | High (winter events) |
| **Mapped landslide initiation** | recharge-scenario choice, cohesion reduction, strength fields, transmissivity | presence/absence, hit rate, precision–recall, spatial overlap | **Highest** (final hazard) |
| Known stable / non-failure areas | false-positive control | specificity / precision | High |
| Runoff / streamflow (if available) | hydrologic partitioning, recharge realism | daily event hydrograph / basin runoff index | High when available |

**Highest-value calibration levers** (current notebook): initial water state; conductivity /
transmissivity scaling (`ksat_factor`, the 2.5 anisotropy factor); snow partition & melt
parameters; root-zone depth family; recharge-scenario choice (local vs routed); and post-fire
cohesion reduction. `number_of_iterations` is **not** a calibration parameter (convergence
testing only).

## 6. Known gaps, risks & sensitivities

- **CRS leakage.** Local `.asc` stacks lack an embedded CRS though config asserts EPSG:32610;
  GeoTIFF/Zarr outputs **must** carry CRS explicitly.
- **Soil-vocabulary mismatch.** POLARIS and SOLUS differ in variable definitions, depths,
  statistics, and units — a provider conversion table is required before mixing them.
- **Slope units.** Landlab expects slope as gradient/tan(θ); some GIS products store degrees —
  make the convention explicit.
- **Precip accumulation.** AI-weather precip may be cumulative or stepwise; daily-recharge
  conversion must be tested per model.
- **Cost.** High-resolution Landlab everywhere in the PNW daily is too expensive — use a hybrid
  of coarse regional screening, targeted high-res watersheds, and (future) surrogate
  acceleration.
- **Hydrologic tiling.** Arbitrary tiles break routing; use **watersheds/subwatersheds** for
  model execution and chunks/tiles for storage.
- **Access sensitivities.** OpenTopography (free key), PRISM 800 m (license), SMAP (Earthdata
  login), ERA5 (CDS license), Synoptic (API token), and some landslide-inventory locations
  (withheld) all require credentials or carry access constraints — see §1.
- **Active-run caveats.** Local `max_recharge` (not routed) is the active forcing, and the
  burn-severity cohesion reduction is currently inactive (§2 warning).
